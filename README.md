# BABEL

**BABEL** is a surreal, infinite 3D library inspired by Jorge Luis Borges' *Library of Babel*.  
Shelves float in the void, books rotate in silence, and the viewer drifts through an absurd, never-ending archive of forgotten knowledge.

## Features

- Trippy floating books and shelves
- Animated surreal geometry
- Procedural duplication for infinite depth
- Abstract fog, lighting, and color shifts
- Built using C++ and OpenGL

## Build Instructions

For now it's only usable on Windows via Visual Studio.
